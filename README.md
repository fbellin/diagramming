# diagramming

I store there for personal use the material useful for my diagramming work with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
This includes :
- logos: companies, technolgies or software products, etc.
- Inkscape document templates
- Python extensions
- Symbol libraries
- Color palettes
- and so on...
